# About the Honor Native Land Fund: 
## Seeking Repair in the Upper Mississippi

Honor Native Land Fund (HNLF) is an all-volunteer network of non-Native people who seek to partner with and financially support Indigenous-led movements for sovereignty and land return. HNLF was started by a small group of descendants of European settlers living in the Dubuque, IA region who were inspired by the growing [Voluntary Land Tax](https://nativegov.org/news/voluntary-land-taxes/) movement, which recognizes non-Native access to stolen Indigenous land through the payment of a voluntary “rent” or “tax” to an Indigenous nation or organization. 

In 2023, HNLF began partnering with the [Great Plains Action Society](https://www.greatplainsaction.org/), an Indigenous-led organization made up of Meskwaki, Ho Chunk, Ioway, and other Indigenous people resisting colonization and working to restore and rematriate land in Iowa. 

## HNLF is inspired by the work of the following organizations:

- [Shuumi Land Tax, Sogorea Te’ Land Trust](https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/shuumi-land-tax/) (Bay Area, CA)
- [Real Rent Duwamish](https://www.realrentduwamish.org/) (Seattle, WA)
- [Honor Tax](http://www.honortax.org/) (Humbolt County, CA)
- [Honor Native Land Tax](https://www.honornativelandtax.org/) (Albuquerque, NM)
- [Manna Hatta Fund](https://mannahattafund.org/) (New York, NY)
