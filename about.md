About the Honor Native Land Fund: Seeking Repair in the Upper Mississippi
============

HNLF is a way of recognizing the reality that non-Native people are living on traditional Native homelands, and taking small steps toward repair of the harm that has been done to both people and land through the forced removal of Indigenous nations from their ancestral territory. HNLF is inspired by the [Voluntary Land Tax](https://nativegov.org/news/voluntary-land-taxes/) movement. 

HNLF began in 2021, when a small group of white descendants of settlers living in the Dubuque, IA, area came together to discuss how we might participate in the growing [Voluntary Land Tax](https://nativegov.org/news/voluntary-land-taxes/) movement, which recognizes non-Native access to stolen Indigenous land. We are an all-volunteer network of non-Native people who seek to partner with and financially support Indigenous-led movements for land-return to local Indigenous organizations and tribal nations.
