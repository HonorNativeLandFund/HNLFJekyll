Giving / How to Give
=========

Contributions to land return for members of the Great Plains Action Society can be made here.

We encourage you to consider your contribution a voluntary “rent” or “land tax” that you contribute as a way of recognizing that you are living on stolen land. Therefore, **we strongly encourage that your contribution be recurring each month.** 

For guidance on how much might be appropriate, you can use this [calculator](https://www.honornativelandtax.org/contribute) created by the organization Honor Native Land Tax.  The calculator is not perfect or “the truth” about what your contribution should be—you know your circumstances best. If they are not reflected in the options that we have laid out, pick those that are closest to your experience.
