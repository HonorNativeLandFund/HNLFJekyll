# Become an ambassador for Honor Native Land Fund! 

HNLF is organized through an all-volunteer network of non-Native folks living in the Midwest who understand that returning land to 
Indigenous stewardship is a necessary part of the racial and ecological healing our society needs. **Help us grow the movement!**

## HNLF posters 
Download and print these posters, and distribute them to businesses, organizations, and churches in your communities. Ask them to check out the website of Honor Native Land Fund and to join this transformational movement! 
**There are 3 choices for posters - feel free to mix and match!**

## HNLF Yard Signs 
- **If you live in the Dubuque, Iowa Area:** Email honornativelandfund@gmail.com to coordinate pick-up of and payment for signs.
We have printed 100, and are asking $5 to cover the cost of each sign. 
- **Organize within your community!** If you live outside the Dubuque area, coordinate with others to print and distribute yard signs!
(We recommend that you print 50-100 signs by using a company like this.)


**We are grateful to Caroline Peters for creating the amazing images for these signs and posters!*
