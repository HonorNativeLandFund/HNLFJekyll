Honor Native Land Fund
=======

Honor Native Land Fund: Seeking Repair for People and Land (HNLF) offers non-Native people living in Iowa and Wisconsin - the ancestral homeland of the Ho Chunk, Ioway, Meskwaki, Sauk, Oceti Sakowin, and others - the opportunity to make an ongoing and meaningful contribution to local Indigenous efforts to restore land and water to Indigenous stewardship. 

By participating in HNLF, non-Native people in Iowa and Wisconsin are recognizing that we are living on traditional Native homelands, and desire to take steps toward repair of the harm that has been done to both people and land through the forced removal of Indigenous nations from their ancestral territory. 

Native peoples have been living in Iowa and Wisconsin since time immemorial. European settlers to this area used violence and other unjust means to colonize the land and forcibly remove the Ho Chunk, Ioway, Meskwaki, Sauk, and Oceti Sakowin peoples in order to make way for white settlement. (See “history.”) Now, **over 98% of agricultural land in Iowa and Wisconsin is owned and controlled by white people and white institutions.** 

Since white settlement of Iowa, due to colonial agriculture, nearly seven inches of nutrient-rich topsoil has been lost to erosion. The water in more than half the state’s lakes and rivers is unsuitable for swimming, fishing, or drinking. Over 20,000 square miles are planted with nothing other than corn. Native prairie now stands in less than 0.5% of its pre-colonial existence. It is clear that through ecological disruption and the displacement and attempted genocide of Native people, **colonization lies at the root of today’s climate crisis**. 

The Honor Native Land Fund, in collaboration with Indigenous-led movements, seeks to take steps toward repairing this harm. HNLF provides the opportunity for non-Native people living in Iowa and Wisconsin to contribute money on an ongoing basis to the [Great Plains Action Society](https://www.greatplainsaction.org/) an Indigenous-led organization made up of Meskwaki, Ho Chunk, Ioway, and other Indigenous people looking to purchase land outside of Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, in order to “resist colonization and to re-indigenize the world around us.”
