# Honor Native Land Fund

### We are on Native land. 

The Honor Native Land Fund (HNLF) is an opportunity for non-Native people living in the in the Midwest - particularly the homelands of the Ho-Chunk/Winnebago, Ioway, Meskwaki/Fox, Sauk, Dakota, and other nations - to contribute to Native efforts to restore land and water to Indigenous stewardship. We invite anyone - from Chicago to Kansas City, from Minneapolis to Saint Louis, and everywhere in between - to participate. 

Through supporting land return, participants in HNLF seek to acknowledge and honor Indigenous people and homelands, and take steps toward repairing some of the harm done through colonization. We believe that returning land to Indigenous peoples is a necessary part of the racial and ecological healing our society needs.  

HNLF has received permission to fundraise money for the [Great Plains Action Society's Land Back Movement][LB]. The Great Plains Action Society is an Indigenous-led organization made up of Meskwaki, Ho Chunk, Ioway, and other Indigenous people looking to purchase land outside of Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, in order to “resist colonization and to re-indigenize the world around us.”

100% of the money raised by HNLF goes to the [Great Plains Action Society] [GPAS].
