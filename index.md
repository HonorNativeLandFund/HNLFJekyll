# Honor Native Land Fund

### We are on Native land. 

Honor Native Land Fund (HNLF) is a voluntary monthly contribution that non-Native people living in the Midwest - from the banks of the Mississippi to the Missouri - make to local Indigenous efforts to restore and rematriate land and water to Indigenous stewardship. 

Participating in HNLF offers non-Native people living on the ancestral territory of the Ho Chunk/Winnebago, Ioway, Meskwaki/Fox, Sauk, and the Oceti Sakowin (among other nations) the opportunity to acknowledge in a concrete way that we live on Native land and to take steps toward repairing some of the harm done by the forced removal of Indigenous people from their homeland.  

HNLF has received permission to fundraise money for the [Great Plains Action Society](https://www.greatplainsaction.org/), an Indigenous-led organization made up of Meskwaki, Ho Chunk, Ioway, and other Indigenous people looking to purchase land outside of Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, in order to “resist colonization and to re-indigenize the world around us.”

100% of the money raised by HNLF goes to the [Great Plains Action Society](https://www.greatplainsaction.org/).
