# Giving / How to Give

Contributions to land return for members of the Great Plains Action Society can be made here.

Consider your contribution to be a voluntary “rent” or “land tax” that represents a continuing effort and desire to acknowledge that you are a visitor living on stolen land. Monthly giving keeps the land’s original inhabitants on the forefront of our thoughts, and provides continual, reliable support for their projects.**We encourage you to make a recurring monthly contribution.** 

For guidance on an appropriate contribution, you can use this [calculator](https://www.honornativelandtax.org/contribute) created by the organization [Honor Native Land Tax](https://www.honornativelandtax.org/).  The calculator is meant to be a guide. You know your circumstances best. If they are not reflected in the options that are laid out, pick those that are closest to your experience.
